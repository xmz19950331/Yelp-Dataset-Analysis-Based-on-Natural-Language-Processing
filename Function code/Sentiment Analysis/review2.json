Often hosted by both Gold Coast Hotel & Casino, and it's sister-complex the New Orleans, VLV is the place to be for a Rockabilly Weekend..\n\nVLV's ROCKIN EVENTS!\n\nViva Las Vegas hosts a lot of different functions that keep everyone interested the whole weekend.  These include:  \n\n* Of course the Swing-Dance & Rockbilly Band Nights! - Every night beginning at 9pm the Bands play and the all-dance begins and continues until 4am!  [No rest for the weary!]\n\n* Swing-Dance lessons - in the evening at 7pm-9pm in the Gold Coast Main Ballroom!\n\n* The VLV Burlesque competition - all eyes are on the delicious ladies sauntering around sensually in nothing but sequins & feathers, a total delight to the eyes.  I was so excited when my friend and fellow Seattle-mate VIENNA won the competition!  She is an absolute beauty.\n\n* Classic Car Show - the outdoor garage complexes are completely taken over by souped up cars from the 50s, 60s and before.  Awesome, customized old school cars were revvin their engines to high decibals level.\n\n* Rockabilly Clothing, Accessories, CDs, etc. etc. VENDING! - I got myself some great Rockabilly shirts, Dickies shirts & Pants for myself and friends.

Loved Reverend Martini's All Night Jumpin Showcase in Brendan's Pub where you can go midnight to 4am was off the Hook with everyone you love on one stage. The Rev even  had including Marky Ramone! Unbelievable! Loved the German Band Ray Collins Hot Club  and Deke's Guitar Festival In fact, the Orleans Hotel where the event is held was sold out for next year before everyone could check out on Monday. Each attendee made their reservation for next year upon check out even though tickets for #17aren't on sale  yet...but they will be! The car show and outside vendors were moved to the front side of th4 hotel a great move. Dick Dale was fantastic! Little Richard was great to have there and see except I wish he would have done more of his vintage 50s \"Rock n Roll\" instead of his Blues since VLV is a Rockabilly Show..and we Rockabilly's love the old Skool Rock n Roll, but still where else do you get to see Little Richard amongst hundreds of Classics and Custom cars and gobs of bands playing for four days and two GIANT rooms full of scrumptious vintage and genre pacific vendors. It was fun to have my room over the pool so each day I could look down on the cool Pool Party! I adore walking through a Vegas Casino and hearing English Top DJ Tom Ingrams cool tunes piped though instead of the icky stuff casinos usually have. Toms music is the BEST! And Speaking of the BEST..Brendans Pub The Reverend Martini's ALL NIGHT JUMPIN SHOWCASE was OFF THE HOOK! How does she get all our favorites to come play on one stage for her each year???!!  She had the infamous living legend drummer of the Ramones, Rock n Roll Hall of Famer, Grammy recipient Mr. MARKY RAMONE on her stage and paired him with the notorious DEKE DICKERSON doing a Ramones set! What a Thrill! Also, both nights she had DALE WATSON, BIG SANDY, PETER OF THE GO GETTERS, ROSIE FLORES, MARTY BROM, BUZZ CAMPBELL, JITTERY JACK, BLOODSHOT BILL, LIL MO & THE DYNAFLOS, PACHUCO JOSE, CHRISTINE NELSON AND MEMBERS OF ROYAL CROWN REVUE,,\"SMITTY\", CHRIS SPRAGUE,, NIKKI HILL AND MATT HILL, THE MEMPHIS KINGS , MOONlight trio all on one stage from midnight to four am. All of the Reverend Martini's Viva Cantina fans and friends came to the show. I was told many new recruits since the Reverend Martini's show in Burbank every Saturday night is a small example of what you can hear at VLV and is represented there all year long . She even teaches the girls the Stroll at her Wednesday and Thursday record Hops so the kids will all be prepared for VLV next year!
